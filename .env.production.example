# =============================================================================
# Railway Production Environment Variables
# =============================================================================
# Copy these environment variables to your Railway project dashboard
# Railway Dashboard > Your Project > Variables tab

# Required: Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# =============================================================================
# EMAIL CONFIGURATION - RESEND API (REQUIRED FOR RAILWAY)
# =============================================================================
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Railway blocks SMTP ports (25, 465, 587)
# ⚠️  Gmail SMTP will NOT work on Railway - use Resend API instead
#
# Why Resend?
# - Railway blocks SMTP ports, so Gmail/SMTP won't work in production
# - Resend uses HTTP API instead of SMTP (Railway-compatible)
# - Free tier: 3,000 emails/month, 100 emails/day
# - No credit card required
# - Easy setup, reliable delivery
#
# Setup Instructions (5 minutes):
# 
# 1. Create Resend Account
#    - Go to: https://resend.com
#    - Click "Sign Up" (free, no credit card needed)
#    - Verify your email address
#
# 2. Get API Key
#    - Login to Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/api-keys
#    - Click "Create API Key"
#    - Name: "Care Refrigeration Railway"
#    - Permission: "Sending access"
#    - Click "Create"
#    - COPY THE API KEY (starts with "re_") - you won't see it again!
#
# 3. Add Environment Variables to Railway
#    Copy these 3 variables to Railway dashboard:

RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here_from_resend_dashboard
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
BUSINESS_EMAIL=khannoor710@gmail.com

# Variable Explanations:
# 
# RESEND_API_KEY:
#   - Your API key from Resend dashboard (starts with "re_")
#   - Example: re_123abc456def789ghi
#   - Get from: https://resend.com/api-keys
#
# EMAIL_FROM:
#   - Email address that appears in "From" field
#   - Use "onboarding@resend.dev" for testing (Resend's free domain)
#   - OR verify your own domain to use custom email like info@carerefrigeration.com
#   - To use custom domain: https://resend.com/domains
#
# BUSINESS_EMAIL:
#   - YOUR email where booking notifications will be sent
#   - Example: khannoor710@gmail.com
#   - You'll receive all customer booking requests here

# =============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Custom Domain Email (Advanced)
# =============================================================================
#
# To send emails from your own domain (e.g., info@carerefrigeration.com):
#
# 1. Add domain in Resend:
#    - Go to https://resend.com/domains
#    - Click "Add Domain"
#    - Enter: carerefrigeration.com
#
# 2. Verify domain:
#    - Resend will give you DNS records (TXT, MX, CNAME)
#    - Add these records to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
#    - Wait for verification (usually 5-30 minutes)
#
# 3. Update EMAIL_FROM:
#    - Change from "onboarding@resend.dev"
#    - To "info@carerefrigeration.com" (or any address at your domain)

# =============================================================================
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT - Gmail SMTP (DO NOT ADD TO RAILWAY)
# =============================================================================
#
# For local testing only - these are configured in .env.local
# DO NOT add these to Railway (SMTP ports are blocked on Railway)
#
# EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
# EMAIL_USER=tarik788@gmail.com
# EMAIL_PASSWORD=whwuxcfjdyzzyerq
#
# Local testing will use Gmail SMTP, production will use Resend automatically

# =============================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

# TROUBLESHOOTING
# =============================================================================
#
# Emails not arriving?
# 1. Check Railway logs for errors: railway logs
# 2. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is correct (check Resend dashboard)
# 3. Verify BUSINESS_EMAIL is correct
# 4. Check spam folder
# 5. Test API key in Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/logs
#
# "Connection timeout" errors?
# - This means you're using Gmail SMTP (won't work on Railway)
# - Remove EMAIL_SERVICE, EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASSWORD from Railway
# - Use only RESEND_API_KEY, EMAIL_FROM, BUSINESS_EMAIL
